## Bingenow

Bingenow is an application to stream movies and tv shows for free. 
The streaming happens through a third-party service, so effectively, this application would be essentially an interface to consume the video(s).


This is a monorepo that holds the code for both the backend and frontend to be a single source of truth and for easier maintanance of the codebase.

## Techstack

Although the streaming service will be provided through a third party, to enchance the user experience,
this application will have its own backend to persist data like watchlist, watch history etc.

The following is the projected technologies that will be used in this project.

### Frontend:

- UI Library - React with typescript
- Authentication - Supabase (Suggestions are welcome)
- State management and caching - React query
- Styling - vanilla CSS
- Build tool - webpack


### Backend:

- Server - Node.js with express (TypeScript)
- Database - Supabase(Suggestions are welcome)
- Hosting - Vercel for frontend, EC2 or lambda for backend(Suggestions are welcome)
- API - GraphQL(likely, yet to confirm)


### Scope

This project is in a very nascent stage, infact nothing has been implemented yet, hence I'm looking for some help in maintaining the project, developing features, components and the UI. I believe the tech stack is pretty interesting and there's an amazing opportunity to learn and build great things here. Infact, even I have not used technologies like Supabase and react query so far. If you're a beginner or an expert in the field of web development, there are numerous opportunities for everyone. I aim to keep this project more collaborative and fun. So, if you're a movie/series buff and would like to build a platform to stream movies/tv shows for free, you should definitely consider contributing to this project. Kindly read the [guildelines for contributing to this repository]().
